Nowadays, most flights do not arrive on schedule at airports owing to excessive traffic or weather concerns. As a result, the majority of flight delays will cause passengers to miss another flight or fail to arrive at their destination on time. Passengers would lose a lot of money and time as a result of the flight delay.
So, we offer our system as a problem-solving system; when people purchase a flight ticket, our system will forecast and inform us as to whether the aircraft will be delayed or not. If the aircraft is delayed, customers can choose whether or not to purchase ticket insurance. The passengers are already aware of whether or not their aircraft would be delayed. As a result, travellers will be able to claim their airline ticket money.
In current environment, this prediction service is not available the app or website, they only give an insurance of the tickets, but persons who have booked tickets. they have no idea about the flight will be going to be delay or not. we check the weather conditions of both place which is the place of flight traveling source and destination point, and their place news and conditions also we use the old data of traveling medium for prediction and we say the flight going to be delay or cancel and we suggest to take an insurance of them tickets and also we suggest to book tickets on another time or date.

Here the for the train model we use the data from Kaggle, https://www.kaggle.com/usdot/flight-delays
